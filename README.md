# test_kriukov
Test the hypothesis that molecules with similar structures cause similar gene expression perturbations.

# Installation

The installation procedure presumes you have installed [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Once you have installed it:

1. Clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:shappiron/test_kriukov.git`

2. Move to the directory with the project:

`cd test_kriukov`

3. Create a new environment:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

4. Activate the environment:

`conda activate test_kriukov`

5. Open the jupyter notebook `solution.ipynb` from where all things happen.

`jupyter-notebok`

# Short answer

I didn't found "significant" (in terms of strength of the effect) correlation between structure similarity and gene expression similarity.
